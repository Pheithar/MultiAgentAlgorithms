# Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

## How to run

## Instance format

Instances are in the `Instances` folder, and are `*.ant`.

```
0 -> Colony position
2 -> Number of ants in the colony
1 -> Food position
3 -> Number of vertex in the graph
-1 1 -1 -> Distances from vertex 0 to other vertices (-1 means not connected)
1 -1 1  -> Distances from vertex 1 to other vertices (-1 means not connected)
-1 1 -1 -> Distances from vertex 2 to other vertices (-1 means not connected)
0 0 -> Position of vertex 0
1 1 -> Position of vertex 1
2 2 -> Position of vertex 2

```
